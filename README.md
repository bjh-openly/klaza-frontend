# klaza-frontend

This repository contains the rebuilt Klaza mobile frontend using the Expo-managed React Native stack. It includes the basic scaffolding to run the app locally and add new features.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Use the Expo Go app on a device or an emulator to open the project. The Metro bundler will provide a QR code and platform-specific options.

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The project uses Expo SDK 51 with React Native. Update the configuration in `app.json` as needed for platform settings.
